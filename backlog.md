## Comments

### #53 · Notify visitors when their comment is approved or replied to
**Depends on:** #19 (visitor comments)

When a visitor leaves a comment on an Insights post, they have no way of knowing when it is approved or when someone replies. This task sends a transactional email to the commenter's address at each of those moments. Visitors must opt-in (checkbox at comment time). The admin moderation queue gains a "send notification" toggle per comment. Uses the existing Resend email integration.

### #54 · Catch comment spam automatically with a CAPTCHA fallback
**Depends on:** #19 (visitor comments)

Bot-submitted comments currently pass through to the moderation queue, cluttering it. This task adds a CAPTCHA challenge (hCaptcha or Cloudflare Turnstile) on the comment form as a last line of defence after the existing Turnstile bot-protection layer. Invisible mode first; visible challenge as fallback on failure. Should integrate cleanly with the current `/api/comments` endpoint.

## Services & Solutions Admin

### #57 · Verify the new services pages with automated browser tests
**Depends on:** #40 (services pages refactor)

The services hierarchy is the most commercially critical part of the site. This task writes Playwright end-to-end tests covering: home → Services nav → services overview page → service detail → solution detail, verifying content renders and links resolve. Tests run in CI so regressions are caught before merge.

### #60 · Preview services and solutions before publishing
**Depends on:** #39 (services hierarchy admin UI)

Editors currently have to publish a service or solution to see how it renders. This task adds a "Preview" button to the service and solution edit forms that opens the public-facing detail page in a new tab with a signed preview token, bypassing the `published` check. The preview token expires after 24 hours.

### #61 · Track edit history for services and solutions
**Depends on:** #39 (services hierarchy admin UI)

Like the post revision system (#48), services and solutions should record a snapshot whenever an editor saves a change, with the editor's name and a timestamp. The admin edit form shows a collapsible history panel. Restoring a revision replaces the current record's fields with the snapshot values (the current state is saved as a new revision before overwriting).

### #62 · Bulk import services and solutions from a spreadsheet
**Depends on:** #39 (services hierarchy admin UI)

Currently the services and solutions data can only be updated row-by-row through the admin edit form or by re-running the seed script. This task adds a CSV/XLSX upload endpoint (`POST /api/admin/services/import` and `/solutions/import`) and a drag-and-drop import UI in the admin, with a column-mapping step and a dry-run preview before commit. Useful for quarterly content refreshes.

## Content Library

### #63 · Add asset categories beyond people and north-star
**Depends on:** #46 (home page image picker)

The asset library currently only supports two categories (`people` and `north-star`), which drive the two home-page image pickers. This task extends the category enum (and the image picker UI) to support additional buckets — for example `abstract`, `event`, `product-screenshot` — so that assets uploaded for other purposes (e.g. collateral hero images, workshop thumbnails) can be browsed by category rather than scrolled through as one flat list.

### #76 · Show a live preview of how a library item will appear on the public site
**Depends on:** #69 (library live content)

When editing a collateral item in the admin, editors cannot see how it will look in the public library card or the featured carousel. This task adds a "Preview card" panel beside the edit form that renders the `CollateralCard` component with the current (unsaved) field values, giving instant visual feedback before saving.

---

## CMS / Post Editor

### #66 · Preview a revision's content before restoring it
**Depends on:** #48 (post revisions)

The revision history panel shows a list of past snapshots with dates and author names. Editors cannot currently read the content of a past revision without restoring it (which overwrites the current draft). This task adds a "Preview" link beside each revision that opens a read-only rendered view of that snapshot in a slide-over panel or new tab.

### #67 · Show a diff between the current version and a past revision
**Depends on:** #48 (post revisions)

Related to #66. Rather than previewing a revision in isolation, editors often want to see exactly what changed. This task renders a word-level diff between the selected revision and the current version of the post, highlighting additions in green and deletions in red, using a library such as `diff-match-patch`.

### #68 · Automatically trim old revisions to keep storage lean
**Depends on:** #48 (post revisions)

Every save creates a new revision. Without a retention policy, the `post_revisions` table grows indefinitely. This task adds a scheduled job (daily cron) that deletes revisions older than 90 days, keeping the 10 most recent regardless of age. The retention window and keep-count should be configurable via admin site settings.

## Heterogeneous CMS Artifacts

### #108 · Bring the FAQ schema onto the shared artifact pattern
**Depends on:** #107 (FAQ → DB + JSON-LD FAQPage) — merged

#107 shipped with a bespoke `status: text` column instead of the shared `artifact_status` enum, and omits `deletedAt`, `unpublishedAt`, `active`, and `featured` / `featuredRank`. The deviation was deliberate (see `faq.ts` inline comment) and is low-stakes today, but it blocks cheap future asks like "hide this FAQ without deleting it", scheduled retirement, and type-safe status against typos. This task migrates `faq_categories` and `faq_items` onto `artifactIdentity` / `artifactLifecycle` / `artifactTimestamps` from `_artifactBase.ts`, updates `/api/faq` and the admin CRUD to use the shared visibility filter, and backfills existing rows so nothing flips to draft on migration. No public-surface change.

---

## Admin Access & People

### #109 · Careers / HR module under `/admin/people/careers`
**Depends on:** admin section reorganization (capability layer + section folders)

Today the admin has a `people` section that manages the team grid and events, but nothing for recruiting. This task adds a Careers module: DB tables for `job_postings` (title, slug, department, location, employment type, status, hero copy, responsibilities, requirements, compensation range, posted/closes timestamps) and `job_applications` (name, email, resume object-storage ref, cover letter, status `new|reviewing|interviewing|offer|hired|rejected|withdrawn`, applicant-supplied fields, timeline of status changes). Admin pages under `pages/admin/people/careers/` for list + edit of postings and a triage view of applications. Public pages at `/careers` and `/careers/:slug` with an apply form that uploads resumes through the existing Object Storage flow. Introduces an `hr` role and an `hr.manage` capability; the existing Careers admin items on the sidebar are gated on `hr.manage`. Transactional email confirmations reuse the Resend integration.

### #110 · Expand the user/role model to seven audience classes
**Depends on:** #109 (or any first work on audience-specific surfaces)

The current CMS has four roles (admin, editor, author, contributor) plus an allow-list flag. The product direction is seven audience classes: `anonymous`, `registered`, `customer`, `internal`, `content_author`, `hr`, `site_admin`. This task introduces the three new end-user classes (`registered`, `customer`, `internal`) alongside a renamed/split CMS side (`content_author` replaces the four-way split where appropriate, or stays granular if editorial workflow demands it — to be decided during implementation). Each class gets a clear list of capabilities. The client-side capability map in `artifacts/synozur/src/lib/capabilities.ts` gains entries for the new classes, and server-side guards learn to accept them. Note: this is a pure authorization-model change; it does not yet build customer-facing portals or internal dashboards — those are separate future tasks once this scaffolding lands.

### #111 · Move the role → capability map into the database
**Depends on:** #110

The capability map currently lives in `artifacts/synozur/src/lib/capabilities.ts` as a hand-edited `Record<RoleName, Capability[]>`. That's fine for today's four roles but will not scale once we're juggling seven audience classes, customer portal permissions, and per-tenant overrides. This task adds a `capabilities` table (`id`, `name`, `description`) and a `role_capabilities` join table, seeds both from the current static map, and switches `/api/auth/me` to return the user's effective capabilities so the client no longer has to recompute them. Admin UI under `/admin/access` gains a capability editor. Existing client code reads `access.capabilities` / `access.hasCapability()` unchanged — only the source of truth moves.
